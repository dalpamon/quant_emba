INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

Finding: REVERSE MOMENTUM (Mean Reversion)
-------------------------------------------
Instead of momentum, the Korean market shows mean reversion during this period:
  • Recent losers (+0.0945% daily) outperformed
  • Recent winners (+0.0237% daily) underperformed
  • Spread: -0.0708% daily (negative = reverse momentum)

Why might this happen?
  1. Market overreaction: Investors overreact to news, creating temporary mispricings
  2. Liquidity constraints: Korean market smaller than US, more volatility
  3. Retail investor behavior: Higher retail participation → emotional trading
  4. Time period: Nov 2024 - Nov 2025 may be unusual (check if typical)
  5. Short horizon: 20-day lookback may be too short for momentum in Korea

Academic Context
----------------
  • Jegadeesh & Titman (1993): Found momentum in US stocks (3-12 month horizon)
  • Our finding: Different result in Korean market (20-day horizon)
  • This is still valuable! Shows market differences matter

Practical Implications
---------------------
  ✓ Momentum strategy would LOSE money in Korean market (this period)
  ✓ CONTRARIAN strategy (buy losers, sell winners) would MAKE money
  ✓ Suggests Korean market is less efficient than US market
  ✓ Opportunities for smart investors who recognize mean reversion

NEXT STEPS (Optional Extensions)
================================================================================

To strengthen your analysis, you could:

1. Test different horizons
   □ Try 5-day, 10-day, 60-day lookbacks
   □ See if momentum appears at longer horizons

2. Test subperiods
   □ Split 2024 vs 2025
   □ Check if results consistent

3. Industry analysis
   □ Does momentum work in tech but not finance?
   □ Sector-specific strategies

4. Size effect
   □ Large cap vs small cap
   □ Do results differ?

5. Robustness checks
   □ Different portfolio sizes (5%, 20% instead of 10%)
   □ Transaction costs
   □ Risk-adjusted returns
